## Tasks Overview

This project includes the following tasks:

1. **Fibonacci Series**: A program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number.
2. **Student Grade Tracker**: A system to track and manage student grades.

## Task 1: Fibonacci Series

### Description
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

### Implementation
- The program accepts an integer input `n` and generates the Fibonacci series up to `n`.
- It is implemented in Python.

## Task 2: Student Grade Tracker

### Description
The Student Grade Tracker allows users to input student names and their corresponding grades, providing functionalities to calculate average grades and display grade summaries.

### Implementation
- The program allows adding, updating, and deleting student grades.
- It is implemented in Python.

## Installation
