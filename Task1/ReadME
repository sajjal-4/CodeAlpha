# Fibonacci Series Generator

This project contains a simple Python script that generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms. The script prompts the user to enter the number of terms they wish to see in the Fibonacci series and then prints the series to the console.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Code.py
   ```

4. Enter the number of terms you want to generate when prompted.

## Code Explanation

The script works as follows:

- It initializes the first two terms of the Fibonacci series, `a` (0) and `b` (1).
- It then enters a loop that runs for the number of terms specified by the user.
- In each iteration, it prints the current term (`a`), calculates the next term by adding `a` and `b`, and updates `a` and `b` for the next iteration.
